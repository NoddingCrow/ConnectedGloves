# ConnectedGloves
CDDA / Magiclysm Mod for toggleable gloves

All non-gauntlet gloves with an inherent encumbrance > 10 available in base CDDA can be crafted into a connected variant.
Connected variants can be (a)ctivated while worn to quickly take them off, allowing them to hang on your wrists. This reduces encumbrance to 5 and negates warmth, environmental protection and coverage values, but allows spellcasting without obstruction.  
Removed Variants can be (a)ctivated again to put them back on, restoring original stats.

## Installation
Unzip the download, place the ConnectedGloves folder in \cdda\data\mods
